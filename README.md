First tryout of Godot based 2D action platformer. 

For now every feature is mainly aimed on mechanics and how (first iterations), and not fine tuned yet. 

Art is mostly placeholders. Mainly made by myself, some borrowed.
Music is home made :) While playing, you can change songs by pressing the "play_song" button. Which button that is depends on the input mapping.

Best to set up your own input mapping for now. Different controllers have different mappings unfortunately.

Use the Test branch for tryout.
