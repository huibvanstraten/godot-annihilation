First tryout of Godot based 2D action platformer. 

For now every feature is mainly aimed on mechanics and the how (first iterations), and not fine tuned yet. 

Art is mostly placeholders. Mainly made by myself, some borrowed.
Music is home made :) While playing, you can change songs by pressing the "play_song" button. Which button that is depends on the input mapping.

*Input Map:* 

Different controllers have different mappings unfortunately.
The Main script has a function that loads input mapping. To change the mapping, change the filepath in this script.
Add your own mapping as a Json in the input_map folder

Use the Test branch for tryout.
